# WASM binaries - IMPORTANT: These ARE committed for PyPI distribution!
# They are bundled with the package so users don't need separate downloads.
# Download with: ./scripts/fetch_wlr_python.ps1 and ./scripts/fetch_quickjs.ps1
# DO NOT add bin/*.wasm to .gitignore - they must be in the repository!
